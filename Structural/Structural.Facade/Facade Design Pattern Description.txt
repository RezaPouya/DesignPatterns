Facade Design Pattern : 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evolved from french wor 'facade' which mean 'frontage' or 'face' 
	
	"Provide a unified interface to set of interfaces in a subsystem.
	 Facade defines a higher lever interface that makes the subsytem easier to use"

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, 
a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

Facade knows which systems and which subsystems are responsible for a request. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choose Facade Design Pattern When : 
	- We want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. Subsystem often get more 
	  complex as they evolve.
	- There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
	- We want to layer the subsystems. Use a facade to an entery point to each subsystem level.
