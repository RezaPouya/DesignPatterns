Flyweight Design Pattern 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flyweight is a structural design pattern that allows programs to 
support vast quantities of objects by keeping their memory consumption low. 


Pattern achieves it by sharing parts of object state between multiple objects. In other words, 
the Flyweight saves RAM by caching the same data used by different objects.


Usage of the pattern in C#
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complexity: 3/3

Popularity: 1/3

Usage examples: 
The Flyweight pattern has a single purpose: minimizing memory intake. 
If your program doesn’t struggle with a shortage of RAM, then you might just ignore this pattern for a while.

Identification: Flyweight can be recognized by a creation method that returns cached objects instead of creating new.
