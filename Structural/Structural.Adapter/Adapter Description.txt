Adapter Desing Pattern :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	"Match interfaces of different classes" 

	And adapter allows two incompatible interfaces to work together . 

	Adapter pattern allows incompatible classes to interact with each other by
	converting the interface of on class to into interface of excepted  by the client.

	leverage on Adapter improve reusability of older functionality .


Chose Adapter interface when :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- A class need to be reused which does not have interface . 
	- We need to work through separate Adapter that adapts the interface of existing
	  class without changing it .
	- Client don't know weather they work with a target class directly or through another
	  alternative that does not have target interface .


	The Ac Adapter is best example of Adapter . 


Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. 
This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this 
pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join 
functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. 
A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as 
an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the memory card 
into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can 
be read via laptop.
